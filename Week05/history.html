                    <p>Cherry blossom pink has been a symbol of renewal, spring, and the beauty of fleeting moments for centuries, especially in Japanese culture.</p>

                    <p>The cherry blossom (æ¡œ, sakura) is Japan's unofficial national flower. It has been celebrated for many centuries and holds a prominent position in Japanese culture. There are dozens of cherry tree varieties in Japan, most of which bloom for just a few days in spring. The seasonal spectacle is celebrated with hanami (cherry blossom viewing) parties under the trees.<p>
